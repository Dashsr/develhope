<p>
  Although early studies of coffee suggested 
  that it could lead to health 
  problems, recent research provides
   strong evidence that drinking 
   coffee actually has a variety of 
   health benefits.
</p>
<p>
  For those who drink coffee, 
  experts suggest brewing it with a 
  paper filter, because unfiltered 
  coffee is associated with higher 
  rates of early death, and can 
  contain compounds that raise levels 
  of LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol. They
   also advise not going overboard 
  with added cream or sugar.
